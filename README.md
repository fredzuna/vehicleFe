I am using [Vue 3, Typescript, Vite], below you can find ways to run the project.

Pending functionalities that need to be implemented

* The pending functionalities that the project needs are sending and receiving tokens. Every time an endpoint is called, we should send the authToken so that it can be validated in BE.
* Usar technologias como tailwindcss , materialUI para que se nos facilite la creacion de componenetes
* Create unit tests for all functionality that is implemented.
